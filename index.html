						<p>March 30, 2019</p>
						<p>Today I went to my first ever hackathon. For the longest time I thought only "real" coders did hackathons and that there was "as-seen-in-the-movies" hacking going on. Which I don't do.</p>
						<p>In the summer of 2018 I went to my second ever tech conference, <a href="https://developdenver.org/">DVLPDNVR</a>. After seeing what the teams came up with at the  hackathon, I realized
						<ol>
							<li> no one does what the hackers do in the moves</li>
							<li>I could at least help on the front end.
							</li>
						</ol></p>
						<p>We started by filling out a survey as to what language we most wanted to use. React, node, Vue, Ruby. I have zero experience with any of them, but React is so hot right now...</p>

						<p>Teamed up, with an idea of what we were working toward, at first I felt lost and unable to help. Lots of words. Lots of techs. Did I mention I has just gotten my laptop the night before because I was meaning to get one for a long time to take to meetups and conferences and such? No. Well, that happened.</p>
						<p>At the moment, I had Chrome, GitHub Desktop, Sublime Text, and because it was recommended, node.js.</p>
						<p>We were given some user stories. We brainstormed ideas. We brainstormed ways to build the thing. We found tools online to help the planning process: online whiteboards and list-making apps. We decided on our stack. </p>
						<p>I started by scribbling. Then using the web whiteboard.</p>

						<p>I am of the opinion that my data modeling skill is one of my strongest. UI/UX Development - needs work.</p>
						<p>I got to put together two pages with working nav and use bootstrap to make them look a bit better than plain text. My teammates refactored it into React. With React? Something something React.</p>
						<p>And somewhere along the way the backend went from a relational database to a not relational database. I think my teammates had fun with that.</p>
