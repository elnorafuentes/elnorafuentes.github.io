		<h3>Project Premise:</h3>
		<p>	The theme of the hackathon is “code review” - we are asking that groups come up with a solution to post code snippets and allow people to comment and give guidance/feedback</p>

		<p>- we will provide a collection of user stories including front end and back end tasks to complete this project</p>
		<p>- at the beginning of this hackathon we will split into small groups (you don’t have to know anyone coming in but are welcome to group with people you know if you’d like!)</p>
		<p>- your group will have the ability to choose your stack. We will have some recommended boilerplates to start from like vue, react, node, and ruby, but you can decide if you want to incorporate something different if you’d like, for example an api like github</p>
		<p>- we will hack through the day and do a retro to talk about what we’ve learned through the day</p>
